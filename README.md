# I'm Anna and my hobby is coding

I was like most middle aged women I know, doing crosswords and playing sudoku, Wordfeud and the odd round of Candy Crush. But I have always been interested in what's behind the user interface, and decided to find out.

My first course on the Codecademy platform was intensive Build Websites from Scartch. That included HTML, CSS and some light JavaScript. Great fun and managable beside my day job.
I moved on to another intensive - Build Front End Application from Scratch, but that had me beaten. Too much too fast, I needed more time with this type of code.
After a break I went on to do single courses in JavaScript and then enrolled in the Front End Engineer Career Path. I spend at least an hour every morning on the course and have finished 47% of the path.

I have a great job and run a business on the side so this is not a new career, it's just for fun. Like a crossword puzzle or game of Sudoku.

##Why coding?

+ Keeps your mind active
+ Learning something new gives you confidence in many areas
+ It is more worthwhile than playing a game or solving a puzzle
